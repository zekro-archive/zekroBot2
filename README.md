     <h1>⚠️ ZEKROBOT2 IS OUT OF SERVICE ⚠️</h1>
 </div>
 
 Sorry, but I've decided to end the service of zekroBot2 officialy. One main reason for that was the development of [**shinpuru**](https://github.com/zekrotja/shinpuru) which was a combination of the main functionalities of zekroBot2 and [**Knecht3**](https://github.com/zekroTJA/knechtV3), which was the management and moderation bot for my [dev discord](https://discord.zekro.de).
 
**`End of service` means that the main host of zekroBot2 is no offline and this repository is now archived. So I will no more add any features, fix any bugs or whatever else and I will focus on my other main projects, i.e. shinpuru.**

Alternatively, you can use **shinpuru** as a replacement for zekroBot2. This bot sets its focus on stability and functionality and will be updated and extended continuously.

[**Here you can invite shinpuru to your guild.**](https://github.com/zekroTJA/shinpuru/wiki/Invite). 


of course, you can still clone zekroBot2 and host it by yourself, if you really want. Read [here](https://github.com/zekroTJA/zekroBot2/wiki/Instalation---Self-Hosting) how to set up self-hosting.
